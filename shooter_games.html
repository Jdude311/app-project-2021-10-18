			<div class="blerb"><p>Shooter games can generally be divided up into two main categories: first-person shooters (FPS), and third-person shooters. The difference between these is the player's point of view: in FPS games, you see through the eyes of the main character, while in third-person shooters, you generally look over their shoulder.</p></div>

        <h2 id="shooter-games">Halo</h2>
        <p>An absolute classic. Halo popularized first-person shooters on console and revolutionized the industry with a strong story and campaign. There are around 10 games, but it's widely recommended to play their campaigns in this order: Halo: CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo Reach, Halo 4, Halo 5, and then the other secondary games like Halo: Wars and Halo: Wars 2 (these are RTS games, however). To download the MCC (Reach, CE, 2, 3, 3: ODST, 4), go <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/976730/Halo_The_Master_Chief_Collection/">here</a> on Steam.</p>
        <p>Below: a demonstration of Halo 3 gameplay on the Xbox.</p>

        <h2 id="engineering-automation-games">Doom</h2>
        <p>One of the first shooters ever, the original Doom was released in 1993 and was played with only the keyboard. It was not possible to look up and down, and simulated 3D graphics using 2D sprites that would face you.</p>
        <p>Doom has come a long way from its 1993 release, and has completely redefined and revolutionized the quick-shooter FPS subgenre with Doom Eternal.</p>
        <p> 
        If you have the attention span of a mouse, Eternal is the game for you. However, Eternal is not for the faint-hearted--quick reflexes and a good stomach are required to play. Check out Eternal <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/782330/DOOM_Eternal/">here</a> on Steam.</p>
        <p>Below: an early Doom Eternal gameplay demo.</p>

        <h2 id="social-games">Arma</h2>
        <p>If you're into milsim games--games that try to simulate real life as realistically as possible--then Arma is for you. The most current iteration, Arma III, has a massive sandbox and lots of physics. Buildings are destructible, weapons have attachments, and lots of vehicular combat: tanks, fighter jets, and APCs are all part of the game. Just beware: Arma has very heavy processor requirements.</p>
        <p>Buy Arma III on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/107410/Arma_3/">here</a>.</p>
