        <p>This is a perfect example of a social game because the whole premise of the game is that there is a group of people who are on a spaceship required to do tasks to fix the ship. But, in this group of people there are "imposters" who sabatage the ship and try to eliminate as many people as possible before the tasks are completed. Additionally, in the game when someone calls a meeting the various people have to guess who the imposter is and kick them off the ship.
